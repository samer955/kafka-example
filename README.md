# Kafka message exchange
Write and Read messages published in topics using Kafka.

Start both programs:

Start first the docker compose file with `docker compose up`. Kafka will be running on localhost:9092

Start the consumer which will be listening for incoming messages.

Start the producer -> Write messages in the console. The messages will be published in the topic and can be read in the consumer console.
